# Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm for shuffling elements in an array.
# This algorithm guarantees a uniform random permutation.
# Shuffling is performed by using destruction swap on elements in the provided array.
# For more information, refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle"

    a = array.length

    # Iterate through the array in reverse order
